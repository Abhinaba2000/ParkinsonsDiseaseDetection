# Parkinson's Disease Detection
To achieve this detetction system, I have used Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model because it is widely considered as an efficient Machine Learning model for classification systems. I have used a vocal records dataset which was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. There was minimal data preprocessing involved because the dataset wasn't relatively large. I have used standardisation on all the records because the data values were considerably discreet. I have seggregated the training and test datasets and then performed model fitting using the training dataset. The results were evaluated against the test dataset. The evaluation concluded when the result showed that the accuracy scores of both the training and test models were almost similar. Based on these conclusions, I was finally able to create a detection system using SVC model.

parkinsons.names - This folder contains proper description of all the medical analysis involving the vocal spectrum of the patient. Multidimensional voice program (MDVP) analysis has been a contributing factor for providing the required survey needed to build this model

parkinsons.csv - This folder contains the actual dataset which contains the results of the analysis. I have crafted my model with this dataset.
